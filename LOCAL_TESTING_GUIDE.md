## Local Testing Guide for SavvyIndians Modern LMS

This guide will help you set up and run the LMS locally with real Supabase integration.

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm installed ([Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/))
- A Supabase account ([Sign up free](https://app.supabase.com/))

### 2. Clone the Repository

If you haven't already:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/priyanshu705/savvyindians-LMS.git
cd savvyindians-LMS/savvyindians-modern-lms
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```powershell
npm install
```

### 4. Set Up Supabase

1. Go to [Supabase](https://app.supabase.com/) and create a new project.
2. In your project dashboard, go to **SQL Editor** and run the contents of `supabase/schema.sql` to create tables and seed data.
3. Go to **Project Settings > API** and copy:
  - `SUPABASE_URL`
  - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - (Optionally) `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for admin features

### 5. Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`:
  ```powershell
  Copy-Item .env.local.example .env.local
  ```
2. Open `.env.local` and paste your real Supabase keys:
  ```env
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key (optional)
  ```

### 6. Start the Development Server

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### 7. Troubleshooting

- If you see errors about missing env vars, double-check `.env.local`.
- If the app can't connect to Supabase, ensure your keys are correct and your Supabase project is running.
- For port issues, make sure nothing else is running on port 3000.

### 8. Next Steps

- To test admin features, assign the `admin` role to your user in Supabase Auth.
- For production, set the same env vars in Vercel dashboard.
